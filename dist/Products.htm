				Distribut-Air rail and duct manifold sections consist of: 
				<ol>
					<li> An aluminum extrusion which serves as a clean, scale-free conduit for the compressed air.</li>
					<li>A Neoprene insert which acts as a continuis valve strip.</li>
					<li>Two locking strips of sluminum to hold the valve strip in place and seal it airtight. </li>
					<li>Integral flanges provide rails for the rolling take-off wheels and for auxiliary trolleys.</li> 
					<li>Mounting flanges hold the clamps which suspend rail or duct in position</li>
				</ol>
				<p/>
				Both ends of the rail section are closed with a seal and end plate. Both ends of the duct section are fitted with a seal
				and end cap. Both ends of the duct section are fittedwith a seal and end cap. One end cap is to be plugged, while the other 
				provides the compressed air inlet.<p/>
				<p/>
				Both rail and duct available in standard sections 5', 10', or 20', long. Special length sections will be furnished when required 
				for the installation.
