			 The Distribut-Air system is the most flexible and versatile means of distributing a continuous supply of air to pneumatic equipment. This system incorporates many outstanding features to increase the efficiency of assembly lines, materials handling systems, and other production operations.

The Distribut - Air system supplies air through a manifold consisting of an aluminum extrusion with flexible neoprene insert. Air is extracted from the manifold, with portable plugs for stationary applications, or rolling take-off wheels for moving conveyor applications and materials handling operations.

Distribut - Air  provides safety and flexibility where pneumatic systems are used. In addition to eliminating the need for long air hoses, this system offers many operating advantages. Some of these advantages are listed here:

  <ul>
	<li> CONTINUOUS AIR SUPPLY</li>
</ul>   

<br/>The Distribut-Air system provides a constant supply of compressed air at any point along the entire length of the system, permitting tool operators to move from one point to another with no interruption or effect on performance of air tools.<br/><br/>

<ul>
  
<li>COMPACT- LIGHTWEIGHT </li>
</ul>

The Distribut-Air system is constructed of aluminum extrusion and castings designed to provide dependable performance and neat appearance.  The aluminum construction also eliminates rust and scale which normally contaminate other compressed air distribution systems.<br/><br/>

<ul>
<li>INSTALLATION FLEXIBILITY </li>
</ul>

Modifications are easily accomplished by installing additional sections of the manifold with the trolley and plugs whenever desired to meet the changing requirements of production operations. The air supply for assembly tools can be revised or repolished easily at minimum cost.<br/><br/>

<ul>
    <li>VERSATILE OPERATION</li>
</ul>

The Distribut - Air system is available with power-type trolley, tow-type trolley, or portable plugs to meet the requirements of each application. Any number of trolleys and/or portable plugs can be used simultaneously on the same section.<br/><br/>

<ul>
    <li>EASY INSTALLATION</li> 
</ul>

Installations are completed in a minimum period of time. The duct is easily installed on a wall, ceiling, or over or under assembly lines for use with pneumatic tools. The rail is suspended overhead by means of suspension clamps for use with air hoists on a bridge cranes and mono rail systems.<br/><br/>

<ul>
    <li>MAXIMUM SAFETY</li>  
</ul>
Improved safety conditions are obtained with this system. It is suitable for installation in hazardous areas as it eliminates excessive and unnecessary hose in work areas, eliminates shock hazard, and reduces damage to tools caused by dropping.<br/><br/>

 
<ul>
    <li>INFINITE APPLICATION </li> 
</ul>
Modular sections are supplied in straight sections of  5, 10, AND 20-foot lengths - and curved sections of 36-inch radius or larger. Provisions are made to connect any combination of sections together to obtain an infinite variety of configurations to fit all applications.<br/>
