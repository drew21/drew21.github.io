			<h3><em>DELIVERING AIR AROUND THE WORLD</em></h3>
			

			<h3>Welcome to DISTRIBUT - AIR MANUFACTURING</h3>
			<br />
			<br />
			The Distribut-Air pneu-shop system is a flexible means of distributing pneumatic power to air tools making the use of 
			pneumatics in your shop as easy and accessible as electric. Pneu-shop eliminates long lengths of hose, reels, and drooping 
			coils. Compressed Air is supplied at any point along an over head rail system. A rolling take-off device travels the rail 
			and is not limited to the line lengths, recoil or the bulk and clearance of festooning.
			<br />
			<br />
			Compact and light, the system is designed to provide dependable performance. More than just versatile, pneu-shop power 
			enhances production.

			<br />
			<p>Modifications of the system are easily accomplished by installing additional sections of rail. Standard 
			sections are available in 5, 10, 15, and 20 foot lengths. Curved sections are special order starting at 36 inch 90 degree 
			radius. By connecting a combination of sections together you can obtain an infinite variety of configurations to fit all 
			applications.</p>

			<p>Installation is quick and easy. Just a few standard tools are required. Our  systems are designed for do-it-yourself 
			installation. Easy to follow instructions will accompany your pneu-shop system.  Pneu-shop is available in a ceiling mount 
			or I-beam suspension system.</p>

			<p>Available with a take-off wheel that delivers air supply to installations demanding a continuous source of power such as 
			cranes, hoists and bridges. Also available in a low cost, roll and spot take-off device for hand held tools.</p>
